Art of ware teaches us not to rely on the likelihood of the enemy not comming but we should be prepared anytime to face him

Background:

	-information security faced rapid changes
	
Computer Security:

	-generic name for the collection of tools designed to protect data and to thawrt hackers
	
Network Security:

	-Measures to protect data during their transmission
	
Internet Security:

	-measure to protect data during transmission  over collection of interconnected networks
	
We are focusing on internet security in this course mainly

Attacks:

	-security attack:any action that compromises the security 
	
		-wide range of attacks
	
	-security mechanism:is to detect recover and prevent security attack
	
		-cryptographic techniques are used
	
	-security service:security of data processings
	
		-enchancing the security of data processing and information transfer of an organization
		
Security Services(X.800)

	-Authentication: assurance that the communicating entity is the one claimed
	
	-Access Control: prevention of unauthorized access
	
	-Data Confidentiality: protection of data
	
	-data integrity: assurance that data is recievd by authorized entity 
	
	-Non-Repudation: Protection against denial
	
Security Mechanism:

	-Specific security mechanism:
	
		-digital signatrues
		
		-data integrity
		
		-authetication
	
	-pervasive security mechanism:
	
		-security audit
		
		-event detection
		
		-security recovery
		
Attacks:

	-passive attacks:
	
		-obtain message contents 
		
		-monitor traffic flows
	
	-active attacks:
	
		-reply previous message
		
		-modify mesage
		
		-denial of service
		
Model for Network Security:

	-Sender
	
	-Information channel
	
	-Recipent
	
Symmetric Encryption:

	-Symetric/Public key encrpytion
	
	-all classical algorithms

Basic Terminologies:
	
	-plain text: orignal msg
	
	-cipher text: coded msg
	
	-cipher: algorithm used for plain to cipher encryption
	
	-key: info used in encryption
	
	-encipher: converting plaintxt to cipher txt
	
	-decipher: recovring ciphertext from plain txt
	
	-cryptography: study of encryption methods
	
	-cryptanalysis: Code breaking, analysis of encryption algorithms
	
	-cryptology: cryptography + crypt ananlysis
	
Types of Cryptanalytic Attacks:

	-ciphertext only:identify plaintext using ciphertxt
	
	-known plaintext: attack cipher using plaintext
	
	-choosen plaintext:select plaintext and obtain cipher text to attack cipher
	
	-choosen ciphertext: select ciphertxt and obtain plaintxt to attack cipher
	
	-choosen text: select plaintext/ciphertxt to encrpyt/decrpyt to attack cipher

Brute Force Search:

	-Try every key
	
	-most basic attack 
	
	-propotional to keysize
	
Unconditional security:

	-cipher cannot be broken since ciphertext provide insufficient information
	
Computational Security:

	-given limited resources, the cipher cannot be broken
	
Substitution Cipher:

	-Cesar Cipher
	
	-Monoalphabatic Cipher
	
	-Playfair cipher(playfair key matrix)
	
	-polyalphabetic cipher
	
	-vigenere cipher
	
	-autokey cipher
	
	-one time pad
	
	-transposition ciphers
	
	-rail fence cipher
	
	-row transposition ciphers
	
	-product ciphers
	
	-rotor machines

Steganorgraphy

	-alternative to encryption
	
	-hides existence of message
	
Block vs Stream Ciphers:

	-block cipher process msg as a block 
	
	-each block is encrypted or decrpyted
	
	-stream ciphers process msg a bit or byte at a time
	
	-each bit is crypted/decrypted
	
	-Fiestel Cipher is an example of block cipher
	
Confusion vs Diffusion:

Feistel Cipher: Cipher based on block cipher

	-block size:increasing size improve security but slower cipher
	
	-key size:increasing size improve security (2 power 64) but slower cipher
	
	-number of rounds:increasing round impreove security but slower cipher
	
	-subkey generation: GRATER complexity make it more secure but slowr cipher
	
	-round function: greater complexity make analysis easier but slowr cipher
	
	-fast encryption/descryption
	
DES(Data Encrpytion Stand): mostly used block cipher

	-encrpyts 64 bit key using 56 bit key
	
Avalanche Effect of DES

Advanced Encryption Standarad (AES) aka Rijndael Cipher:

Blowfish: A symmetric block cipher
	
	-fast implementation
	
	-compact use in memory 
	
	-simple structure eases analysis/implementation
	
	-variable security by varying key size
	
	-use 32 to 448 bit key
	
	-Use addition and XOR for its operation
	
RC5

Stream Cipher:

	-process the message bit by bit (as stream)
	
	-mostly have random stream key
	
	-XOR with plain text bit by bit
	
	-must never reuse stream key
	
Stream Cipher Properties:

	-long period with no repitions
	
	-statistically random
	
	-depends on large enough key
	
	-large linear complexity 
	
	-corelaton immunity 
	
	-confussion
	
	-diffusion
	
	-use of high non-linear boolean functions	
	
RC4 	

Confidentiality using symmetric encryption:

	-link encrpytion
	
	-end to end encryption
	
Random Numbers

Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs)

	-algorithmic technique to create "random numbers"
	
	-although not truly random 
	
	-can pass many tests of randomness
	
Blum Blum Shub Generator 

	-base on public key algorithms
	
	-unpredictable, passes next bit test
	
	-slow since large numbers must be used
	
	-too slow for cipher use, good for key generation
